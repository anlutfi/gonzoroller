The Gugusse Roller is the second machine to transfer film to digital that
I've created and built.

For the moment the project is still under development, there is a lot
of information available on the Gugusse Roller Facebook page.

In progress also is a website for anyone to build his own Gugusse Roller:

The Gugusse Roller uses a Raspberry Pi and various combinations of Raspberry Pi Cameras and lenses.
the objectives of the software is to:
    -Drive the 3 stepper motors
    -read the 3 discrete inputs:
        1. film hole detector
        2. left arm aligned in middle
        3. right arm aligned in middle
    -capture each frame, save it as jpeg and transfer the file to a ftp server

Files Explained:

    transferMovie.bash: Recommended entry point to perform a transfer, it verifies the sequence number or create a new directory on ftp server, starts a script that upload picture files that are ready and call the main executable.
    Gugusse.py: Main executable, don't call it directly, use above file
    manualControl.py: use it directly to adjust camera setting, camera aiming, camera focus, film tension, hole sensor and to control motors.
    turnoff.py: call it directly to unlock all 3 motors.
    TrinamicSilentMotor.py: Library used by Gugusse.py
    GCamera.py: Library used by Gugusse.py and manualControl.py
